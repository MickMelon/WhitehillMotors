# Whitehill Motors Website

This is a college project where I needed to create a database-driven, responsive website for the fictional company Whitehill Motors. This was achieved using PHP, JavaScript, HTML and CSS (Flexbox). 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Web server environment (e.g. XAMPP)
```

### Installing

Upload all files to your webserver environment. For example, in XAMPP, upload this to:

```
C:\xampp\htdocs\whitehillmotors\
```

Import the whitehillmotors.sql database file via phpMyAdmin, for example.

Edit the /includes/connection.php file to match your database connection details.

```
$host = 'localhost';
$dbname = 'database_name';
$user = 'username';
$pass = 'password';
```
